	<h1>Assignment 3</h1>
		<h2>Reading Questions</h2>

			<h3>Do's and Don'ts of Web Design</h3>
				<p>The <a href ="https://www.art.yale.edu/" >Yale School of Art's Webpage</a> violates do number 6 by having headings that look like clickable buttons.</p>

			<h3>Better User Experience Through Storytime Articles</h3>
				<p>Framing your project in a story format can help refine your ideas by giving it a human touch. What I mean is that the storytelling approach to web design can help your site feel much more human. Like a person was behind what is being displayed, and not just a blank screen with information with no flair and spice. Storytelling adds character to a webpage, and it'll help the user connect with what you're trying to say much easier.</p>

			<h3>Meet Your Type: A Field Guide to Love</h3>
				<p>You can establish proper and effective hierarchy by doing things such as msking using of various font families that connect with what you want your users to see, adjusting things like font size, line spacing, etc., as well as making sure to avoid clutter with your text. A good example of a site that displays excellent typography hierarchy would be <a href = "https://www.apple.com/">Apple's website.</a> The site makes use of font types as well as the size and general spacing of the text to create an appealing webpage, while making sure to avoid clutter in all the right places. </p>

		<h2>Creative Brief</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Problem: There's not an easy way to find retro game stores near you.</li>
				<li>Audience: Those who like retro game collecting in actual stores rather than just buying them online.</li>
				<li>Competition: Sites like PriceCharting, VideoGameStores, and 2ndHandGeek all do something similar to my idea, in various fields with varying degrees of success.</li>
				<li>Key Messages: With this project, it will help those out there who love the thrill of going to the store to buy video games, and cater to those who love collecting older titles to play or collect, while also giving highlight to small independent businesses in their area who specialize in this field.</li>
				<li>Call to Action: Come use the site to see what retro game shops are in your area, and give them the business they deserve for working in a bit of a niche market.</li>
				<li>How to Measure Success: Have feedback from users, whether it's a place where they can discuss any cool retro game stores they've discovered in their area thanks to the site, or shout outs to any small businesses who have been given more public knowledge due to the site.</li>
