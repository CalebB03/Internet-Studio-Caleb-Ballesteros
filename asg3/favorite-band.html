	<h1>Electric Light Orchestra</h1>
		<h2>A Brief Description of the Band</h2>
		<p> <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_Light_Orchestra">Electric Light Orchestra (ELO)</a> are an English rock band formed in Birmingham in 1970 by multi-instrumentalists Jeff Lynne and Roy Wood and drummer Bev Bevan. Their music is characterised by a fusion of pop and classical arrangements with futuristic iconography.[3] After Wood's departure in 1972, Lynne became the band's sole leader, arranging and producing every album while writing nearly all of their original material. During their first run from 1970 to 1986, Lynne and Bevan were the group's only consistent members.</p>

		<h2>Why I Love Them</h2>
		<p>I love the band due to their unique style of music, and the scope of their work in general. It's pop rock mixed with an orchestra, and it leads to a unique sound that I feel not many artists can truly replicate. They are truly one of a kind in that regard. The tone of their music tends to vary between super upbeat songs with a few mellow ones here in there. A few of their albums, such as Eldorado and Time, try to stick to a theme in their music, and this further adds to their uniqueness. They are a band that I can never get tired of listening to. Whether if it's while I'm getting up in the morning or doing schoolwork, the Electric Light Orchestra has been with me for years, and I don't see myself picking anyone else over them.</p>
