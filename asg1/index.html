	<h1>Assignment 1</h1>
	<h2>Three things I learned from readings:</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>Critical web design is a vast tool, and it can include things that can be categorized as internet art, software activism, and cultural production.</li>
		<li>The web has been constantly expanding since its inception, and continues to do so at an alarming way, to a point where the internet that we're used to currently could soon be tossed aside in the blink of an 
			eye.</li>
		<li>A thing to keep in mind when creating things for the web is to always encourage expirimentation, as the internet is a giant playground for us to play around with and test things to our heats content to see
		what works and what doesn't.</li>
	</ol>
	
	<h2>Semester Project Idea:</h2>
	<p>An idea I had for my semester project was a website catered to those who are interested in the retro game market and are interested in a way to make collecting older games more convenient, and may help them find more
	options than just looking on amazon or ebay. It would allow the user to search for a particular game, and instead of focusing where it can be bought online, it can help locate the game of their choice at a retro game
	store. As a retro game collector myself, I much prefer going to a store instead of relying on the internet. This project can help users find out if a store is carrying a particular game through postings by the store
	themselves through the site, and the results can come through a search. Some retro game stores are privately owned, and may not even have a website of their own, and at the most may only have a social media page to post
	the games they may have gotten through trading and the like. This project can also be another way for the smaller stores to make themselves known, and users may discover a store they may not have known existed in their
	area. If it's too ambitious, I may change the idea a tad to maybe have it serve it as a method of discovering retro game stores in one's area, instead of having postings of games that a store may have. Might make other
	changes as time goes on, but this is where I am in my thinkng process.</p>
