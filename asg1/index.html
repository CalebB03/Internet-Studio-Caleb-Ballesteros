	<h1>Assignment 1</h1>
	<h2>Three things I learned from readings:</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>Critical web design is a vast tool, and it can include things that can be categorized as internet art, software activism, and cultural production.</li>
		<li>The web has been constantly expanding since its inception, and continues to do so at an alarming way, to a point where the internet that we're used to currently could soon be tossed aside in the blink of an 
			eye.</li>
		<li>A thing to keep in mind when creating things for the web is to always encourage expirimentation, as the internet is a giant playground for us to play around with and test things to our heats content to see
		what works and what doesn't.</li>
	</ol>
