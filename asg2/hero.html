<h1> The Thing </h1>
<h2>The Origins of The Thing</h2>
<h3>Overview</h3>


<p> <a href="https://www.wikipedia.org">The Thing </a> (Benjamin Jacob "Ben" Grimm) is a fictional superhero character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. He is a founding member of the Fantastic Four. The Thing was created by writer-editor Stan Lee and artist Jack Kirby, and he first appeared in The Fantastic Four #1 (cover-dated Nov. 1961). Known for his trademark rocky appearance, he has superhuman strength, a sense of humor, and the battle cry and catchphrase "It's clobberin' time!". The Thing's personality and background is heavily modeled by Kirby's own background. A key feature throughout his character arc has him struggling to accept his newfound powers, which often culminates in his returning to his human form before going back to his mutated form. Eventually the Thing came to accept his mutated form and even found love with and married blind sculptor, Alicia Masters, and they adopted two alien children.</p>


<p>Created by writer-editor Stan Lee and artist Jack Kirby, the character first appeared in The Fantastic Four #1 (Nov. 1961). Although Thing's speech patterns are loosely based on Jimmy Durante, Kirby modeled the character after himself.</p>

<p>In addition to appearing in the Fantastic Four, the Thing has been the star of Marvel Two-in-One, Strange Tales (with his fellow Fantastic Four member the Human Torch), and two incarnations of his own eponymous series, as well as numerous miniseries and one-shots.</p>
