			<h2>Conversations with Robots Article Questions</h2>

				<li>Structured Content is when content is framed in a way that is concise, but contains it in a way that all relates to each other. Semantic HTML is when content on a page has certain meanings that need to be defined on webpages, like headings and lists.</li>

			<h2>Questions on Readings</h2>
			<ol>
				<li>Of all the methods listed, I feel Go For "Good" Instead Of Superlative would be most successful for me. This is due to the field I'm studying, which is game design. Sometimes when making a game, thinking of perfection clouds my judgement of what's important when making the game. I know if I shoot for just creating a functioning product without losing sleep over the final details, I'd have more motivation to actually finish the project.</li>
				<li>Hyperbolic Discounting is when an individual has more rational thinking and decision making when they are forced to wait. One method McRaney points out to counter this is thinking about future-you's choices and their effects. I feel this would work for me as it gives off a sense of planning ahead, which is something I do frequently. So I would be able to adapt this method with ease.</li>
				<li>I feel that as creators, a network-making power we have is the power to dictate what is and isn't on our creations. We also have the power to control the heirachry of nodes and the structure. What we don't have control over, is who gets to access our creations, and whether or not our creations reach our target audience.</li>
